# state_machine

Assignment for second year Applied Computer Science at Saxion.
Made for the course: Advanced Programming Concepts
Made together with @koalatje2000

The description for the assignment was: 
Finite state machines are everywhere. Many control systems are programmed using this approach because it’s flexible, easy to test and hard to break. You’ll explore different ways of implementing state machines. Starting with enumerations and jump tables (or switch statements) and finishing with more abstract designs where states are easily extensible objects with loosely coupled actions and transitions. You’ll have to demonstrate your mastery of this topic by writing a small control application, preferably on an embedded system.
